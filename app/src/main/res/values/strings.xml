        This sample demonstrates how you can schedule an alarm that causes a service to
        be started. This is useful when you want to schedule alarms that initiate
        long-running operations. Click START ALARM to activate an alarm to check
        the Google home page for a custom doodle once a day. If the app finds a doodle,
        it posts a \"Doodle Alert\" as a notification. Click CANCEL ALARM to cancel the
        alarm. Once the alarm is active, it automatically restarts when the device is
        rebooted.</string>
